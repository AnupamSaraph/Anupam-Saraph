							<h2>Innovation</h2>
						Anupam Saraph established the<a href="#AboutSystems" title="Get a quick introduction to actor based understanding of systems"><code>actor</code> based understanding of<code>systems</code></a>laying the foundation of the practice of<br><code>change research</code>and<code>future design</code></a> <br>as a means to
						create <code>symbiotic,</code><code>sustainable,</code><code>resilient,</code><code>inclusive,</code><code>fair</code>and <code>anti-fragile</code>systems.</p>
						<p>His research for the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (<a
						href="https://www.rivm.nl/en/about-rivm/rivm" title="Learn more about RIVM" target="_blank">RIVM</a>), in 1993-94, gave rise to <a href="https://github.com/AnupamSaraph/Dissertation/blob/master/PhD%20Dissertation/Toolbox%20for%20Tomorrow.pdf" title="Access the Ph.D. thesis of Dr. Anupam Saraph that documented his work on actor based systems and actor based modeling" target="_blank">actor based modelling</a> that models the<code>interaction</code>of individual actors in a system, allowing them to recognize the consequences of their actions and search for interventions that accomplish the common purposes of their systems.</p>
						<p>He also introduced the idea of<code>mission based governance</code>while he served as Advisor to the Government of Goa, laying the foundation for a government that was<code>purposive</code> rather than procedural. He also laid the foundation for<code>symbiotic</code>interactions between citizens and the government that were free from the need to repeatedly establish identity, and that provided a means to engage in<code>common purposes</code>without constraints.
