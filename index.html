                    <div class="content bodytext fade-in-bottom">Acclaimed as being “astonishingly creative and an
                        educator in the best sense of the word”, Anupam Saraph has been making the magic of
                        systems leadership accessible to institutions and individuals across Asia, Africa, Europe,
                        and the Americas. He has brought inspiring insights and empowered unconventional interventions
                        through his methods.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1994, systems thinker Donella Meadows highlighted that Anupam had invented "a new kind of
                        modeling and a new philosophy" that recognized for the first time, “that 'systems' arise,
                        ultimately, out of consciousness; that the most profound way to understand a system is to
                        understand its consciousness; and that the most inexpensive, elegant, and lasting way to
                        change a malfunctioning system is to change its consciousness”. The resulting field of
                        <i>possibility innovation</i> has enabled innovative and impact-making designs and responses 
                        that shape the futures of systems, institutions, and individuals they sustain. <br><br> 
                        Since then, Anupam has not only empowered leaders to future-proof their systems but also 
                        to create environments where their participants thrive in more livable and sustainable systems. 
                        He is driven to inspire and empower systems leadership in every system to identify leverage that fosters 
                        robustness, resilience, sustainability, and livability so the systems and their participants may thrive.<br><br>
                        Anupam's methods have empowered systems leadership across the United Nations, World Economic Forum,
                        Club of Rome, governments and public institutions across continents, NGOs, small, medium, and large
                        businesses, as well as communities, bringing the art of possibility, responsibility, and empathy 
                        to their worlds. With it, they have improved alignment to common purposes, refined their missions, and 
                        brought robustness, sustainability, resilience, and livability while furthering their causes, accomplishing
                        phenomenal growth, and creating lasting value.
                        <br><br>
                        He also mentors and builds capacity for systems thinking, writes columns, and finds connection,
                        energy and joy in deep conversations, reading, music, and being with nature –
                        wildlife, freshwater streams, mountains, and wilderness. He occasionally dabbles in watercolors,
                        gardening, and harmonium.<br><br><br><br>
