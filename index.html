                    <div class="content bodytext fade-in-bottom">Acclaimed as being “astonishingly creative and an
                        educator in the best sense of the word”, Anupam Saraph has been making the magic of
                        systems leadership accessible to institutions and individuals across Asia, Africa, Europe,
                        and the Americas. He has brought inspiring insights and empowered unconventional interventions
                        through his methods.
                        <br><br>
                        In 1994, systems thinker Donella Meadows highlighted that Anupam had invented "a new kind of
                        modeling and a new philosophy" that recognized for the first time, “that 'systems' arise,
                        ultimately, out of consciousness; that the most profound way to understand a system is to
                        understand its consciousness; and that the most inexpensive, elegant, and lasting way to
                        change a malfunctioning system is to change its consciousness”. The resulting field of
                        <i>possibility innovation</i> has enabled innovative and impact
                        making designs and responses that shape futures of systems and the institutions and individuals
                        they sustain. <br><br>Since then, Anupam's methods have empowered systems leadership across the
                        United Nations, World Economic Forum, Club of Rome, governments and public institutions
                        across continents, NGOs, small, medium, and large businesses, as well as communities, bringing
                        the art of possibility, responsibility, and empathy to their worlds. With it they have been able
                        to improve alignment to common purposes, refine their missions, and bring sustainability,
                        resilience, and robustness while furthering their causes, accomplishing phenomenal growth, and
                        creating lasting value.

                        He also mentors and builds capacity for systems thinking, writes columns, and finds connection,
                        energy and joy in deep conversations, reading, music, and being with nature – particularly
                        wildlife, freshwater streams, mountains, and wilderness. He occasionally dabbles in watercolors,
                        gardening, and harmonium.<br><br>
