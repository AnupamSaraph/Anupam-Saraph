        <h1>Professor of Sustainability and Governance of Complex Systems, Environmentalist, and Future Designer</h1>
        <p>Systems thinker and scientist, Anupam Saraph established the <a href="#AboutSystems" title="Get a quick introduction to actor based understanding of systems"><i>actor</i>

            create
            symbiotic, sustainable, anti-fragile, and resilient systems.</p>
        <p>His research for the Dutch National Institute for Public Health and the Environment (<a
                href="https://www.rivm.nl/en/about-rivm/rivm" title="Learn more about RIVM" target="_blank">RIVM</a>), in 1993-94, gave rise

        </p>
        <p>He <a href="#AboutFutureDesign" title="Get a quick introduction to change research and future design">works with leaders, and mentors teams</a>, to help them to identify
            their
            systems, recognize the common purposes of its actors, and accomplish their toughest <i>shared</i>
            challenge - their mission. He has advised
            several
            national
            leaders, and has also served as the governance and IT Advisor to Government of Goa and its former
            Chief Minister, the late Manohar Parrikar. Over the
            last ten years, Dr. Saraph has also been working together with Swedish Water Prize recipient and
            Magsaysay Awardee Dr. Rajendrasingh and hundreds of social activists
            working for the cause of protecting the environment and rivers of India from exploitation,
            encroachment, and pollution.

        <p>He has served as the CIO of Pune City and an Advisor on projects across Asia to develop

            order to explore
            resource transitions and sustainability. </p>
        <p>Since 1989 he has advised several organizations including the French Ministry of Research, the

            Scotland on economic, energy, and environmental
            coordination methods (ECCO) for
            modeling national, regional and global economies, and applied them to explore the carrying
            capacity and the potential for growth. </p>
        <p>He introduced the idea of <i>mission based governance</i> while he served as Advisor to the
            Government of Goa, laying the foundation for a
            government that was purposive rather than procedural. He also laid the foundation for symbiotic
            interactions between citizens and the government that were free from the need to repeatedly
            establish identity, and that provided a means to engage in <i>common purposes</i> without
            constraints.

        <h1>A Quick introduction to actor based systems</h1>
        <p>When you come together with a purpose to share joys and sorrows, you form a system we call as
            friendship.
            When
            you come together with a purpose to raise children, you form a system we call as family. When you
            come together with a purpose
            to
            empower,
            you form a system we call as companionship. When you
            come
            together
            with a purpose to learn, you form a system we call as a class. When you come together with a purpose
            of working
            together,
            you form
            a system we call as employment. When you come together with a purpose to entertain, you form a
            system we
            call a
            club. When you come together with a purpose to exchange goods or services, you form a system we call
            as
            a
            market. When you come together with a purpose to exchange surplus money, you form a system we call
            as
            banking.
            You get the idea. <a
                href="https://earthcharter.org/courses/introduction-to-systems-thinking/" title="Learn more about systems at this 5 week course run by the Earth Charter International" target="_blank">Every purpose you participate in with others is a system.</a> </p>

        <p>Remove those who came together for a purpose and you don’t have that system anymore.</p>

        <p>Add new participants and you don’t have the same system anymore. Change the purpose and you don’t
            have the
            same system anymore either.</p>

        <p>What you experience in the system is not a result of <i>who</i> are part of the system but is a
            consequence of the <i>interactions</i>
            of
            those who are part of that system with each other and with you. Whether it yields the desired
            outcomes,
            the
            desired change, whether it makes you feel helpless or able, whether you feel you included or whether
            you
            feel
            you
            belong, results from the purpose and the interactions of those who are part of that system.</p>

        <p>A system where participants come together for a <i>common</i> purpose has the foundations of
            symbiotic
            relationships.</p>

        <p>A system where participants do not share a common purpose has the foundations for exploitation of
            each
            other. It has the foundations of encroaching on the roles the participants play in their own systems
            or
            other
            systems they are a part of. It has the foundations of polluting their interactions with each other
            or
            those
            of
            other participants, in other systems that they are a part of.</p>

        <p>A system where the interactions of participants are rooted in their respect of each other ensures
            that
            such
            systems will be not violate the dignity, justice or liberty of each other. A system where
            participants
            come
            together for common purposes the symbiotic relationship ensures that the system is not exploitative.
            In
            such
            a
            system, none of the participants look at maximizing their benefits. They look at pursuing their
            common
            purposes.
            None of the participants encroach on the roles of the other participants, or the other systems the
            other
            participants are a part of. They protect the liberty of the participants to engage in other systems
            and
            the
            roles
            they may play in those systems. They do not pollute the systems they are a part of by mixing their
            purposes
            or
            mixing their roles. </p>

    <h1>A quick introduction to Change Research and Future Design</h1>
        <p>What makes something edible is not the individual ingredients but the recipe. What makes a good
            recipe, again, is not the ingredients but the result of the interactions of its ingredients. The
            individual ingredients do
            not have the property of the recipe. The interactions of the ingredients result in the properties of
            the recipe.
        </p>
        <p>
            Similarly, if we collect the best cooks, the best kitchens, the best ingredients and the best
            recipes, we do not have the best restaurants. We may not even have a restaurant. The restaurant is
            more than the sum of its
            parts. It is the result of the interactions of its parts. None of the <i>parts</i> have the property
            of a good
            restaurant, it is only the interactions of the parts that do.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we collect the best cooks, best teachers, best engineers, best doctors, best farmers and so on,
            we do not have the worlds best community. We may not even have a community. A community is not the
            sum of its
            parts. It is the result of the interactions of its parts. None of the individuals in the community
            have the
            properties of the community, it is the interactions of the individuals that do.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we collect together the best roads, best schools, best, hospitals, best farms, best entertainment
            centers and put them together, we do not have the best livable city. We may not even have a livable
            city. None of the infrastructure of a city has the properties to make
            it the best livable city. It doesn’t have the properties to make it livable either. It is the
            interactions of
            the parts that make up the city that do.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we put together the best automobile industry, the best technology industry, the best financial
            industry, the best consumable industry we do not get the best sustainable economy. In fact, we may
            not have a
            sustainable economy at all. None of these industries have the properties of the economy. It is the
            interactions
            of the parts that make up the economy that do.
        </p>
        <p>
            If we put together the executive, legislature, and judiciary with the best and the brightest
            persons, we will not get the best government. In fact, we may not get a government at all. None of
            these have the
            property of good government. It is the interaction of these parts that make up the government that
            do.
        </p>
        <p>
            <a href="https://earthcharter.org/courses/systems-leadership-the-earth-charter-and-the-sdgs/" title="Learn more about how to Change Research and Future Design through Systems Leadership at this 5 week course run by the Earth Charter International" target="_blank">The    
                whole is the system that results from the interactions of the parts.</a>
        </p>
        <p>
        The parts do not have the properties of the whole that make the whole not only functional but
        invaluable. The parts cannot accomplish the purpose that the whole can and often does. Whether sourcing
        the best
        manpower, infrastructure, material or even information, few recognize that it is worthless to do so
        unless the
        interactions of these with the other parts can result in the whole system that we desire.
        </p>
        <p>
            Solution shopping in our world takes apart Humpty Dumpty with the intention to put in the best parts
            to upgrade the functional whole. Every economy wants to have the best industries. Every city wants
            the smartest
            infrastructure. Every business wants the smartest people. Every recipe wants the best ingredients.
            We even want designer individuals, designer animals and designer plants. In the name of innovation
            and progress,
            we tear apart our systems that made them what they are and put together the parts which have no
            ability to
            interact together to provide systems. Certainly not the systems where the interaction of the parts
            will
            result in the properties that serve the purposes for which the parts came together in the first
            place. We do
            not understand systems. We may be very intelligent, yet we are systems illiterate.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we pull apart natures plumbing, its streams, rivers, ground water flows, and replace it with
            the best engineering for storing or transporting water we don’t get a water system, we destroy the
            water
            system that sustains our water cycles.
        </p>
        <p>
            When we replace forests with “green” transportation systems that will “fix” our cities growing
            mobility needs, we destroy not just our forest, we destroy our city. When we pull apart communities
            in the name of
            progress, we
            don’t get progress, we destroy the harmony of the community that makes our life come alive.</p>
